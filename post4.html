		<h3>ECommerce WebApp for Candy Warehouse Store</h3>

		<p>Jack's candy is a warehouse store that wholesales candy to local food stores and suppliers. The app features a whole
			catalog that is updated by the crew team. There is online shopping features as well as other user friendly items such
			as contact and location info.
		<br>
		<br>
		The Front End consists of React JS. There are features such as a parallax scroll effect, a bottom navigation bar,
		Ability to change user theme settings. Included are different layouts such as grid, relative, and constraint layouts. 
		<br>
		<br>
		The Back End consists, SQL azure data server to handle transactions. We use payment transactions securely and orders are updated in real time. There is an available shipping information that is available on an admin dashboard. The app supports shipping to locations across the country in the United States where each city is considered its own
		"instance" of database, so some locations may have less data than others. 
		<br>
		<br>
		The process of the app, works by having the user browse through the catalog. The user will then look for any items they would like to purchase. Any items added will be updated on the Cart.
		The cart will also save any information that the user previously saved. Then upon checkout the user will be able to see a subtotal amount of their order.
		The user will also add shipping information and lastly, pay for the order to process it in the warehouse.
		<br>
		<br>
		This is a project I took on for several years. Another team manages the site now, but the website is still available to view and is up and running to the public.</p>
