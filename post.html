		<h3>Resouce Locator App</h3>

		<p>Cup of Sugar was an Android built & designed for Android. It helps users in need of resources to find an locator people nearby that are 
			either willing to donate resources or receive resources.
			
		<br>
		<br>
		The Front End consists of Android XML. There are features such as a parallax scroll effect, a bottom navigation bar,
		Ability to change user theme settings. Included are different layouts such as grid, relative, and constraint layouts. 
		<br>
		<br>
		The Back End consists, of Kotlin files that handle the Android Activity Pages. We use APIs from Google such as Ads for supportive revenue Android
		Maps to use Geopoints for user to access. The app supports locations across the country in the United States where each city is considered its own
		"instance" of database, so some cities may have less data than others. Authentication is also available; users are able to make accounts.
		<br>
		<br>
		The process of the app, works by having the user register an account, they will then be able to log in with that account. The user can then browse 
		for resources that they can use based on location. The user can also have the option of creating a new post (donate a resource) with pictures and images for others in area to see.
		Supportive resources are included as well to find help and reach out to local groups online that can provide additional resources or help lines.
		<br>
		<br>
		I worked on this system for 6 months before releasing it to Google Play, a minor disclaimer is audience activity is low.</p>
